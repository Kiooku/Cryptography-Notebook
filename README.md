# Cryptography Notebook

## What is that ?

It's a repository with some of the cryptographic implementations I have done for learning purposes.

## Why the repository is almost empty ?

I'm learning cryptography by myself, until then by solving cryptography challenges on CryptoHack and Root-Me.

Currently, I'm reading "An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography" (Second edition), and in order to apply the mathematical knowledge and get a better understanding, I decided to create this repository.

Learn, understand, and create project is a long process, which is why the repository will contain more implementation month after month.
